I am Miguel Gomez, a developer wanna be from Argentina, currently living @ [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires) but originally from [Tucuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucum%C3%A1n_Province). I donÂ´t get tired of learning new things all the time, being amazed with new technologies and I hope I can make some commits to this world &nbsp; &nbsp; :earth_americas: &nbsp; &nbsp; we live in! :grin:
